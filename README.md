# Adaptive Meshing Tools for TOAST++

This repository contains work done to develop adaptive meshing packages for the TOAST++ Software for Diffuse Optical Imaging under [Dr. Simon Arridge](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/S.Arridge/).
Check out the TOAST Library [here](http://web4.cs.ucl.ac.uk/research/vis/toast/) and their Github repo [here](https://github.com/toastpp/toastpp).

This repo is in a bit of disarray, and I'm working on the documentation. If anyone wishes to uses this code, let me know and I'll speed things up!
